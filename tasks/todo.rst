Package Requirements Format
===========================

* Comments which are part of the requiremets data structure, for ease of
  machine rewriting.

Windows Development Support
===============================================================================

* Investigate ``conda`` for environment management.
  If viable, then recommend its installation instead of ``asdf`` if the
  development environment is not a virtualized Linux, such as WSL.

* Create ``develop.py`` script and manage Pythons on all platforms via that.
