    ''' Version manager.

        Compatible with the version scheme laid forth in
        `PEP 440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-scheme>`_.

        Core Format: ``{{major}}.{{minor}}``
        Release amendments extend the core format by appending
        ``.{{amendment}}``.
        Development prereleases extend the core format by appending
        ``a{{timestamp:yyyymmddHHMM}}``.
        Release candidates extend the core format by appending
        ``rc{{candidate}}``, where ``candidate`` starts at ``1`` and increases
        by one upon each increment.
